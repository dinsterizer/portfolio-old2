In this tutorial, we will deploy a Laravel demo project to [Railway](https://railway.app/) with minimal effort and cost (free).

## What is the railway.app?

[Railway](https://railway.app/) is an infrastructure platform where you can provision infrastructure, develop with that infrastructure locally, and then deploy it to the cloud.
The best part is that use builder [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs) under the hood to detach and deploy your project automatically.

## Benefits of Railway over other platforms

- **No credit card required** - Railway is free to use and you can deploy your project for free.
- **No need to configure your project** - Railway will automatically detect your project and deploy it.
- **No need to configure your infrastructure** - Railway will automatically provision the infrastructure for you.
- **Free SSL** - Railway will automatically provision a free SSL certificate for you.
- **Free domain** - Railway will automatically provision a free domain for you.
- **Starter && Developer plans** - Everything is free if your monthly cost is less than $5.

## Drawbacks of Railway

- **Not support well for PHP project** - But totally fine for a demo project (this post will demonstrate).
- **US location only** - You can't deploy your project to other locations but will be supported soon.

## Prerequisites

- A Railway account
- A Laravel project
- A GitHub account & a GitHub repository for your project

## First prepare for Railway

1. **Create an empty project on Railway** - Just click the `New Project` button and select `Empty Project`
2. **Create a database on Railway project** - Click the `New` button -> select the `Database` option -> select which one do you like. I recommend you use PostgreSQL for your project because it spend very little memory versus MySQL.

## Secondly prepare config in your repository

Please create the below files in your repository:

```toml title="railway.toml"
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"
nixpacksConfigPath = "nixpacks.toml"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3
```

- **builder** - Railway will use `Nixpacks` to build your project.
- **healthcheckPath** - Railway will use this path to check if your project is running or not (2xx response is oke). You can remove this config if you don't want to use it.
- [Docs](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/config-as-code) for more information

As I said before Nixpacks doesn't support PHP projects well, so we need to create a `nixpacks.toml` file to make it well.

```toml title="nixpacks.toml"
[phases.build]
cmds = [
    "...",
    "php artisan migrate:fresh --force",
    "php artisan config:cache",
    "php artisan cache:clear",
    "php artisan event:cache",
    "php artisan route:cache",
    "php artisan view:cache",
    "php artisan storage:link",
]

[start]
cmd = "php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${PORT:-8000}"
```

By default, nixpacks will use nginx for start command but I had some issues with it related to permissions and used resources.
So I decided to use `php artisan serve` instead (only for demo project). Read more about [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs).

By using `php artisan serve` I reduced 400MB memory usage to 100MB memory usage (TALL Project).

```php title="app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php"
public function boot(): void
{
		if (\App::environment('production')) {
				\URL::forceScheme('https');
		}
}
```

Because Railway will connect to your project via HTTP so we need to force HTTPS in our project to fix `url()` generate problem.

## Finally deploy your project

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Railway** - Click the `New` button -> select `GitHub Repo` -> select your repository -> click the `Connect` button.
2. **Setup domain** - Click the `Project` -> select `Settings` -> click the `Generate Domain` button.
3. **Configure your Laravel environment** - Click the `Project` -> select `Variables` -> click the `Raw Editor` button -> copy `.env` file in your local machine -> paste it -> click the `Save` button (remember change database connection and app URL).

## Conclusion

That's it. You can now access your project via the domain that Railway generated for you.
